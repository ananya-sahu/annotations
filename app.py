        Welcome to the caption annotation task! Please follow the instructions below:

        Please select your assigned annotator ID to begin. Once you proceed, you **cannot change your ID**.  
        
        **Annotation Task Instructions** üìù
        1. Each image has 6 captions. **Your task is to rank each caption on a scale of 1 through 6 where 1 refers to the captions that have the most literal description of the image and 6 refers to captions that have the most abstract descriptions of the image.**
        For clarity, literal descriptions of images will provide a straightforward, factual account of what is visually present in the image. Meanwhile abstract descriptions take more creative liberty, conveying the essence, emotions, or symbolic meaning rather than capturing the concrete details.
        2. **Each rank should be unique**‚Äîno duplicate rankings for a single image.
        3. **Select a rank for every caption** before submitting.
        4. **Click "Submit"** once you have ranked all captions for an image.
        5. Your progress is saved automatically, and you can resume later if needed (make sure to enter the same annotator id below).
